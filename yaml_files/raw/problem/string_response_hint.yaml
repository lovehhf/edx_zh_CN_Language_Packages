        >>Which U.S. state has the largest land area?<<

        =Alaska {{Alaska is 576,400 square miles, more than double the land area
        of the second largest state, Texas.}}

        not=Texas {{While many people think Texas is the largest state, it is actually the second largest, with 261,797 square miles.}}

        not=California {{California is the third largest state, with 155,959 square miles.}}

        ||Consider the square miles, not population.||
        ||Consider all 50 states, not just the continental United States.||
