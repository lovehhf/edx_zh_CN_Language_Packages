    display_name: Checkboxes with Hints and Feedback
    markdown: |
      
      You can provide feedback for each option in a checkbox problem, with distinct feedback depending on whether or not the learner selects that option.

      You can also provide compound feedback for a specific combination of answers. For example, if you have three possible answers in the problem, you can configure specific feedback for when a learner selects each combination of possible answers.

      You can also add hints for learners.

      Be sure to select Settings to specify a Display Name and other values that apply.

      Use the following example problem as a model.

      >>Which of the following is a fruit? Check all that apply.<<

      [x] apple  {{ selected: You are correct that an apple is a fruit because it is the fertilized ovary that comes from an apple tree and contains seeds. }, { unselected: Remember that an apple is also a fruit.}}
      [x] pumpkin {{ selected: You are correct that a pumpkin is a fruit because it is the fertilized ovary of a squash plant and contains seeds. }, { unselected: Remember that a pumpkin is also a fruit.}}
      [ ] potato   {{ U: You are correct that a potato is a vegetable because it is an edible part of a plant in tuber form.}, { S: A potato is a vegetable, not a fruit, because it does not come from a flower and does not contain seeds.}}
      [x] tomato  {{ S: You are correct that a tomato is a fruit because it is the fertilized ovary of a tomato plant and contains seeds. }, { U: Many people mistakenly think a tomato is a vegetable. However, because a tomato is the fertilized ovary of a tomato plant and contains seeds, it is a fruit.}}


      {{ ((A B D)) An apple, pumpkin, and tomato are all fruits as they all are fertilized ovaries of a plant and contain seeds. }}
      {{ ((A B C D)) You are correct that an apple, pumpkin, and tomato are all fruits as they all are fertilized ovaries of a plant and contain seeds. However, a potato is not a fruit as it is an edible part of a plant in tuber form and is a vegetable.  }}

      ||A fruit is the fertilized ovary from a flower.||
      ||A fruit contains seeds of the plant.||
